### Ai: Introduction

The final goal of this unit is to be able to fully create a interactive digital film using a suggested platform, YouTube. The created digital film's final goal is to be able to help younger audiences, such as the primary or middle years (PYP & MYP) student and must highlight and mention a conflict or problem which has to be solved throughout choices within the film. The choices should help the younger audiences understand and choose the correct answer and be able to experience multiple endings and consequences, in addition, these problems have to be relatable to the younger audience to further aid them in the future, such as a moral or advice.

During this process of achieving the final product goal, we would have to research and understand the different types of media and sources we could utilize, cinematic skills for filming the digital film in addition to the quality of the final product, but also the plot and structure of a film; How to make it convincing? / relatable?

The Key concept of this unit is <ins>Relationships</ins>. *Relationships* itself can be defined as your blood, friendship, negative or positive relation to a person or object. Whereas in this unit, Relationship is very important as it firstly help the audience understand consequences, such as the choices which would prompt up in the digital film, it helps the audience understand and learn how choices impact others (**relationship between individuals and the consequences**). Moreover, by doing so, it may build empathy depending on the choices that the audience makes.
Lastly, relationships can also highlight how certain situation or scenes can be relatable to the younger audience, which allows them to connect with the characters and their choices, allowing a more impactful experience.

As for the Related concept of this unit; <ins>Perspective</ins>, referring to someone or something's point of view which could or not be regarding something or someone. In this context, perspective can be utilized to suggest / prompt multiple endings or consequences. Similarly, this also allows a more interactive and engaging learning, by prompting a larger variety of perspectives in-scene / in the film.

Regarding this unit, I personally believe that the final product is very interesting and unique, compared to the previous years' course. It stimulates our creativity and critical thinking in various steps of this unit, such as understanding the preferences of the younger audience and their feelings, especially when they are entering a stage of change and independence. Furthermore, it is very interesting to be able to work with video editing and filming, as it is a relatively new topic which I have not studied yet. The main ideas or problems that come to my mind are: Bullying, stress, anorexia, various phobias, and there are multiple ways to work with it to achieve the final product. As for now,  I would be interested in building a interactive film through a platform or method other than YouTube, since at the very start of the Unit, it already looked quite straightforward and a little bit easy, and alternatively, creating a simple website with overlay prompts with video playing should be possible, or even utilising scratch. Anyhow, the final product should have a large variety of choices to engage a larger quantity of audience and each perspective.

Lastly, to mention again, the target audience of this task are targeted specifically to the younger audience, or, if necessary, a wider audience within the ISM community. The audience is usually in its teenage years, so there should be considerations of sensitive topics, such as deaths, traumas, but also appropriate content which are suitable for their age. 

Overall I believe that this task is worth giving it a try and achieving not only because it is a new topic which I haven't touched yet, but also because it includes some very interesting topic and new skills for filming, video editing, and dedicated technical skills to make a digital film become interactable. Moreover, I believe this task would benefit us by raining and engaging our research skills, self-management skills, as this task is independent, unlike the previous unit. 

### Aii: Research Plan
A common question which I had to research was "*What was an interactive film*" which is a very essential question being the task's main focus and final product.

### Aiii: Analysing Existing Products
#### "Heist" by Markiplier
Although I did not look through all of the possibilities and prompts of the interactive film, I did go through a single selection of choices and failed. *The Heist* by Markiplier ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TjfkXmwbTs)) is a interactive film with the protagonist, or the main guide as a famous youtuber called Markiplier, and you, the audience, as his accomplice for robbing a "box" an escaping.
The narrator is external, Markiplier with a first person internal focus as you being Markiplier's accomplice helping him robbing the mall. The first scene, which can be considered as an introduction to the whole series, starts, and is kept the same, as a first person render of what you are expected to see, it uses something similar to a bodycam allowing the viewer to be more integrated into the movie but also to be able to decide as if you were in the film. Further more, the film itself has a great atmosphere, which is likely thanks to the ambient lighting, which is dark, and the use of a shallow light towards whatever need to be concentrated on in the scene, but also the presence of guards and dodging the guards' flashlights and attention, this builds up suspense and tension, allowing the audience to become more interested and integrated into the film. On the other hand, it might not be considered as a technique, but the audio and sound being used are very thought through carefully and deliberately, such as the removal of background noise, the guard's footsteps, certain sounds, but especially Markiplier's tone makes the film much more captivating and lively. The transitions being utilised in this film are very smooth, they would typically "spin" the camera and while the screen is "blurred" during the spin, it would have already changed scene. This technique has been used throughout the film to create smooth yet effective outcomes, such as enlarging the stage (by sort of attaching a new scene in front of a scene with same background).
Moreover, I found very interesting their use of location and how to prolong each of the user's prompts, Markiplier, the guide character and narrator, is constantly interacting with us, the audience, which allows us, similar to previously mentioned techniques, to be "at the moment" or the scene where its taking place in. None of the scene are replaced and are all new and the endings and start of your choice are very smooth and an enjoyable experience. I think a great factor of this film was that you were a part of the heist at all times, the camera was always close to you or Markiplier, sometimes slightly overhead by captures all the details with the protagonist or Markiplier in it. 
Overall, I believe this was a great interactive film. Even though it did not focus on the same primary goal as us, it still showed a big variety of techniques which can be utilised to create an effective yet appealing interactive film which captivates the audience's attention and allow them to create choices accordingly (to the plot) and show the different consequences clearly by the obvious and evident right or wrong reaction by Markiplier and subsequently the actions that you eventually do correct or wrong.

#### "Bathroom fight" by Lagarto Films
This film is basically what the title suggests, a fight in the bathroom. The plot of this film is very simple with no moral or advice but rather for entertainment, in addition, the scenes in this film are very very short, which allows a more fast paced and interactive film. Its basically getting the sequence of offense correct to beat down the hitman that is trying to get rid of "you". The introduction scene was very effective at producing this eerie atmosphere and the building up tension through the rising volume of the background music. Most of the camera angles are parallel to the character and sometimes side profile view. The lighting throughout the film (located in the bathroom) is most likely to be a dim artificial light, rather than a natural or the lights in the bathroom. The editing on some parts were also very effective in giving the "kick" or "punch", as the camera man and editor have decided to add "shock", such as blurring the borders of the current scene to give the punch this sense of disorientation and focus on the hit.
Throughout the upcoming scenes, more camera angles have been utilised, such as a camera angle pointing from bottom to up, such as in the tornado kick, or when their eyes meet, the camera is fixed on the details on the character's eyes, which is utilised to understand the two character's current emotions. 
A good method to allow choices is present in this film, as the film kind of stops, slowing down the time in the scene, which allows the user to choose between the options, such as "parry" or "dodge" during the showing up of prompts, while the protagonist character stays in an "idle" kind of pose of his current action allowing the audience to choose.
Overall, even if the plot and final focus of the project isn't the same as my task, the plot (fight) is very interesting, because most of the audience would usually think that the protagonist would always win, but in the film, it was quite balanced and you could potentially lose if you didn't pick the correct choice.


#### Horror Interactive Video by HyperisticNiku
Similar to many horror interactive "film" or games, these types of YouTube Videos require the audience to make the correct choices and in most cases, escape a site or a haunted house. In this specific interactive horror film, it makes you the protagonist in first person and you simply have to guess which prompt will be correct, since it is a horror interactive film, it has some horror characters and settings, unlike other easily completable interactive films, which is very similar to going through a maze with no plot or context.
IN this horror interactive film, it starts off with something I find very different from others, which can be considered as incipit medias res, unlike the other two I have analysed, it gets directly in between an action. This can be utilised to instantly grab the audience's attention, furthermore, in this introductive scene, a body cam at a lowered angle has been used, probably to show the effect of being in the first person, allowing the audience to be integrated into the story more.
There were different camera types and angles utilised throughout this play, but I believe the most effective one was the well use of editing  and special effects which allowed the creator or director to create such an effect.
The film utilises common features and characteristics from other horror games and films to build up tension, such as the use of music, the vignette in certain scenes to focus on a single point on a screen, and the good use of the final scene to allow the user to decide carefully what to do next, as it seems as if time has stopped, and the audience has to carefully prepare a fast and correct choice among the prompted choices.



### Aiv: Design Brief
Throughout my research based on my key and most important research questions, I have also encountered some other related questions which came across my mind, helping me understand better some topics and techniques which I didn't understand previously.

==**What is a common problem for teenagers?**==
As the final product is targeted at younger audiences, which is probably in my case grade 7-9,  which I personally see it as a period of freedom but also for self-discovery, but can also be very difficult due to various emotional or physical difficulties, which can or cannot be caused by the obvious puberty changes. One of the key difficulties which even I have personally encountered is identity formation, as one would commonly try to find a suitable position for itself in the community around him. "Who am I?", "What is my purpose?" usually are the questions being asked, and sometimes can be brought to extreme levels, which can bring psychological harm, such as social anxiety and depression, or also physical harm, such as anorexia, or the related. Most of these however can be only raised after considerable time under certain conditions of self-doubt without any type of moral or professional support, or in the contrary, abuse or bullying. This type of self-doubt could make it difficult for the individual to commit important life decisions, such as career paths, relationships, and personal values.
Although the second issue may not be particularly important, considering that ISM is an international school, but financial strain might still be present for some individuals, due to whatever restrictions they have. Especially when parents have high demands and are very "pushy", leading to individuals to enter the workforce or enter higher levels of education such as universities, they encounter financial stress. Such as student loans, job insecurity, and a very common factor which may not apply to my audience, but living expenses and bills.
The third point, which may also be a extremely important point, rising concerns for a individual's mental state, which can be easily affected and changed by the smallest of factors, since the mental state of my target audience is very likely to be very vulnerable, given that they are still in a phase or self-exploration and testing different styles for themselves. Some of the likely causes are, stress, anxiety, sometimes feelings of isolation, depression, and loneliness. 
The last point, which is what I would personally like to talk about for my final product is Social Navigation. To be specific, in the online social media platforms which lots of young people start to use, especially in this modern era. It is important to restrict or monitor online behaviours and contacts, to keep online safety and privacy, as it is common for individuals to look for romantic or platonic relationships online.
These are the four most common difficulties which I managed to find online, as they were some of the  longer lasting problems which still is today, but also as they are some key factors and causes which can significantly impact a young adult's life. 
By using this information I have obtained through this research, I have understood the priorities and the various consequences each of the causes have, which allows me to pick what I believe is the most significant and vulnerable, which would in the end, have a greater affect on the audience.

[jbcnschool.edu.in](https://www.jbcnschool.edu.in/blog/common-teenage-problems-solutions/)

The sources that have been used can be considered as very reliable, especially the second source, as it is a blog / article published by an international school, similar to ours, which not only share a very common context but also information according to other websites such as "verywellfamily.com". Furthermore, the article has been published relatively recently, (in the more modern years where access to social media and cyber bullying became frequent due to the easy access to the web) which makes the topics and points discussed in the article's body more relatable and new, which is unlikely to be changed immediately.

==**What are some common platforms for hosting interactive films?**==
Through a small online research and online forums, I have discovered several platforms which host interactive films, unfortunately however, these possibilities are paid, which means I had to find alternatives. 
There were different types of methods I found out which could help me create an interactive film:
The first and easiest of which, was the intended method, which was utilizing YouTube to create interactive films by prompting end-screen cards at the end of a video to redirect the user to the selected scene which they have chosen, which would follow a flowchart, which will determine if their choice was correct or wrong. Editing and filming aside, this method is very simple and easily achievable will little to no technical knowledge required other than being able to upload and organise videos in a well structures manner.
The second method, which can also be considered as a game, is the use of Game engines. Compared to the first choice, utilising a game engine to create an interactive film proves to be a lot harder then simply following a flowchart and directing scenes from it, as it requires a minimum amount of knowledge on the gam engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine or GameMaker, but also being able to create scenes and animations, with buttons / overlays / prompts, which the user can click to move on to their selected theme. Moreover, there are various difficulties and limitations utilising this method. The time consumption and knowledge required aside, it is very hard to market or publicize the final product, which unlike YouTube is an easily universally accessible website, people would have to download your app or development files to view the final product.
The final method which can be utilised to host an interactive film are dedicated platforms such as Twine, inkle, Branching Out, which are specifically designed to create and host interactive films and movies. These are much more easy to make since they have a tailored interface  and editing tools for easier editing. However, this also means that there are certain limitations, as some of the services or tools are blocked or restricted by a paywall, which can be from exporting the file, to basic tools needed to make an interactive movie. 

[ghostretail.com](https://www.ghostretail.com/post/best-interactive-video-platforms)

The source being used to answer this question can be considered as reliable, but some of them can be potentially biased, as Ghost is a website which promotes services to host your online video and marketing. On the other hand, it explains in great detail what interactive films are, its pros and cons, and the differences from traditional films and interactive films and they can have a huge difference in the outcomes if it comes down to sharing a message or moral. Moreover, the Source has been edited very recently; April 11, 2023, which similarly to the previous statement, allows the points being discussed to be more recent and up to date, with minor possible errors.

==**What are the more efficient technical and cinematic elements used in interactive films?==
Efficient technical and cinematic elements in interactive films prioritize two key aspects: **visually attractive presentations** with **engaging interactivity** and **compelling storytelling**. Branching is a key factor here, one that is realized through the choices given to the viewer. Sometimes these choices are plotted out on **decision trees**. The complex technical frameworks like **the game engines** can manage these branching stories and user inputs without any difficulties. On a cinematic level, creators often opt for **clear and purposeful choices** to keep viewers from being overwhelmed, which in turn **fosters emotional attachment** by means of effective character development, impressive visuals, and powerful music. The ability to create an immersive environment is the most important factor for interactive films because it requires a fine balance between giving the viewers the chance to choose and still retain a cohesive cinematic experience.
Using this knowledge I have gained, it will be easier to understand and utilise different techniques and elements in my final product, which would hopefully help the audience better understand the moral and the purpose of the final product through the different choices they have taken.

This source can be considered as very reliable and authentic, as being a official hosting platforms for enterprise interactive films, it explains itself "The New Era in Film History", discussing all the new possibilities and elements which engage the audience. Furthermore, the article has been posted relatively recently; February 17th 2022, this allows the contents of this article to be less biased and subject to change any time soon.



==**In what ways to interactive digital stories engage younger audiences effectively?**==
Interactive digital stories are highly engaging for the younger generations as they **are intrinsically drawn to exercises of control**.In some cases, the audience not only **can influence the story** but they also become an important part of the story. This feeling of ownership helps to establish a stronger **connection with characters and their story** since the outcome depends on their actions. Moreover, the interactive nature of the format matches with young generation's **technology savvy and familiarity with games,** thus the experience is natural and stimulating. Moreover, interactive stories can be developed so as to **implement gamification components**, e.g. points, rewards, and challenges, to **stoke up engagement and motivation** to take different narrative routes. To an extent, this set of aspects target the short attention spans of the youth, offering them with **interactive and personalized** experiences that are much more than ordinary storytelling formats.
Utilizing this knowledge, I can implement these different ideas into a the project which will theoretically significantly boost the efficiency and how interactive it is in the final result. Furthermore, these suggestions can be utilised to my advantage by adding elements or concepts which are very familiar or favourable for the younger audience to get their attention.

==**How do existing interactive films handle sensitive topics such as bullying, stress or traumas?**==
Existing interactive films use the mix of gentleness and imagination to explore difficult themes such as bullying, stress, and trauma. Narrative branches typically have **options between healthy coping and possibly dangerous behaviors**. It is through this that the viewer can **try the outcomes of various choices** in a secure simulation. Moreover, several interactive films now employ **trigger warnings**, and **content advisories** to alert viewers beforehand, while others provide **resources and support information** during or after the experience. Nevertheless, the dilemma is finding a way of being **authentic** without showing graphic content that could be **triggering**. Many films use **symbolic representation** and **metaphorical language** to express the strength behind the theme and this is done without giving out explicit details. Overall, the success of dealing with the sensitive storylines is based on the **maturity level** of the target audience and the **excellent presentation** of the narrative and interactive elements.
Utilising this information, I can understand the limitations to the choices I can include into my interactive film, which would not only help me understand better which type of content to restrict and which ones are more suitable to be put on the scene, but also in order to reach the final comprehension of the moral in an effective yet unharmful way.

The source being used to understand the key  methods and reasons of cyberbullying, stress and traumas are authentic and reliable, since the information source is from an "organization", and I know it is authentic thanks to its "org" domain. Furthermore, the article has been written by Sameer Hinduja, which is a well known figure in the organization after researching her profile on socials such as linkedin.

==**How can cinematography and editing techniques be adapted to enhance the interactive aspect of the film?**==
Cinematography and editing techniques could be potent instruments of the interactive film. **Framing** is implemented to **emphasize the decisions’ points**, implicitly guiding the viewers to the interactive features. **The close-up shots** are meant to enhance the emotional effect of the decisions and **changing the angle of the camera** helps to visually separate the narrative branches. Editing is very important for keeping the transition **fluid** between different paths, and the use of jump cuts or parallel editing, for example, is a technique that can show consequences of choices clearly. **Sound design** can also be altered, as changes in music or sound effects can mark distinguished parts of the story. The main idea lies in **tailoring these methods to the particular storytelling pattern** and ensuring that they do not **undermine the cinematic experience** while **promoting user experience**.
Although filming the final product may not be my final decision in the form I will make my final product in, it is still important to understand the different Framing, Camera angles and common editing software tools and filters as it can significantly change a scene's meaning, depending on the distance of the camera or the colour and ambient lighting (sfx).

==**What are the different cinematographic techniques and editing techniques I should know in order to produce an effective interactive film?**==
Making a good interactive movie requires both classic cinematography and editing approaches as well as some new techniques. Fundamentals like shot size, composition, and lighting are still important, but you'll have to learn to adapt them to a changing environment where the audience determines the direction of the film. As mentioned earlier, it is important to use dynamic camera angles and framing that foreshadow player actions, and real-time editing that elegantly switches between the pre-rendered content and the user-driven activity. Also, the exploration of techniques such as branching narratives and non-linear editing is useful to create various options for the audience and result in a personalized experience for the audience
Learning how to use these different techniques to my advantage will not only make the creation of the final product faster and more efficient,  but also it will allow the audience to understand the point of the plot in a technically better structured scene, whereas just a simple camera recording the events in a room for example.

The source being used to retrieve the information for the two questions above can be considered as reliable, since the provider of the information is MAGICX, which is a digital online video editing platform. It is likely to be reliable since as a company, it is only natural for them to discuss the advantages and key important tools and essentials to improve user experience and using their platform. ON the other hand,I was unable to see the last updated  or when the article was written, which means that this srouce ca nbe subject to change and bias

==**How have other interactive digital stories effectively incorporated the concept of choices and their consequences**==
A vast majority of the well-crafted interactive digital stories take the users through choices and consequences in the engaging storylines. Take "Black Mirror: " Bandersnatch"-a choose-your-own-adventure movie, in which viewers are the ones who make the important decisions for the protagonist, thus, determining the plot's direction and the fate of the character. This highly tailored experience makes them feel in control and responsible, as they are forced to reckon with the consequences of their decisions. Similarly, role-playing games like "The Witcher 3: The game "Wild Hunt", for instance, has branching narratives considering player choices. Such decisions affect everything, from character relationships and quest outcomes to the overall global state, which makes the player feel there is control and this deeper immersion into the story's world. Interactive digital stories achieve more than just amusement. By integrating choices and consequences, they transform viewers and players into active participants and leave a lasting impression that goes beyond the last scene.
By understanding how the choices, and especially *how* choices may affect the relative consequences, a directory like me can fully take advantage of this to create prompts and scenes perfectly suited for the perspective and thoughts of the audience.

| Aesthetics          | The final product should be visually appealing with clear and easy to understand information. This includes using contrasting colors and fonts for text and other visual elements. The design should be sleek and minimalistic. Transitions between scenes and prompts should be created with fade-in effects with a slight blur for a smooth user experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The final product should be easy to comprehend, visual and appealing colors and contrast between the different elements on the screen. Such as certain texts or signs, labels, or other visual elements on the screen. In addition, a sleek and minimalistic font design should be used for the UI of the final product, such as the prompts and subtitles and narrations. When a new scene loads, it should appear from a fade in from black, which goes the same for the appearance of user prompts. Before the user prompts, the fade in black of the final bit of the scene with a 1-10px blur effect on the video (via css) and the slow-mo of the final 15 seconds of the scene, which will allow the students to decide on their next choice. If ignored, a random prompt will be selected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Cost                | The major cost concern is the hosting of video and scenes, which I have decided to use github or bunny.net's cdn. The final budget for extra materials should be invested at a limit of 100 euro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The total cost will vary, but some certain data is 0.01eur/1GB/month from bunnycdn or free if I use github, but may reach limitations as a github repository is limited to 1 GB. As for the rest of the cost, it should be limited to approximately 100 euros, which include expenses for the props which would most be hand made / drawn or crafted which I will be adding into the scenes whereas others will be purchased online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Audience            | This project targets younger students at ISM, from middle school (MYP, grades 7-11) potentially up to high school (grades 12-13).<br>To achieve this, I will be doing the following:<br>- **Relatable situations:** Slang, common events, and situations relevant to younger students.<br>- **Cliffhangers:** Scenes ending in a way that makes them want to interact and see what happens next.<br>- **Moral dilemmas:** Scenarios like bullying or catfishing will pose a choice, with the "correct" option initially disguised. This lets students think critically by comparing the positive and negative outcomes of each choice. | The Audience of this project should mainly centre towards younger audiences of ISM; including the entirety of MYP ( Grades 7-11) which can possibly reflect towards Grades 12 and 13. In relation to this, it is possible to easily attract the target audience's attention by using slang or common actions or events / situations the younger audience can relate to, and wanting to know the next scene's ending, forcing them to interact and finding out more of the plot. This can be for instance, bullying, or being the victim of an act of catfishing or bullying, and to correct or teach them, by guiding them purposely to the wrong pathway as the correct pathway, but then allowing the user to play through the genuine correct option, so the user can critically think him/her-self about which of the two pathways was more adequate by comparing the two pathways and the two endings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I will be utilising a static vanilla website to display my website through the use of overlay prompts on a video element on html using css and javascript and preloading the videos hosted on third parties which I will be importing using the content delivery network (cdn).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Functions           | Website shows interactive prompts that change the story. Story avoids predictable endings for a better learning experience. Plot subtly tackles a teen issue, letting viewers recognize signs through the story's events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The final product of website should be able to display the different prompts on the scene which are prescribed and stated in javascript dictionary which forwards the clicked prompt with the corresponding film and its following prompts. The overall use of prompts should allow the story to continue develop without the final meaning or scene to be predicted, allowing a more steady and effective study method. The story's plot should be able to contribute to the development of a specific event or teenage issue without directly addressing it, which will only be revealed by the end of the plot. With the events which happen in between, the audience will be able to recognize the symptoms or events which can happen which later and where it could potentially lead them to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

As for the audio and sound effects I will be using Audacity and Lalal.ai for changing voice and fade in and fade outs, reverbs, and for background noise cancellation. Furthermore, For the video hosting, I will be using a CDN provider, which can be Github through githack proxy or bunnycdn. The method I will be hosting my website will be Github Pages, which allows free static website hosting with our own source code, therefore I will be using Visual Studio Code as editor and commit through Github Desktop. As for the filming, I will be using my phone's camera (50mp) and recording with 2k60fps, and I will be using a dji stabilizer and skaters to record longer scenes and panorama shots in the final product.<br>The final product should be a static website with the video playing after a play or start button, with buttons which overlay (achievable using Z-Index in CSS) which with fade in by the end of every scene (using javascript video events and functions) which will follow a timeline states prior using a javascript dictionary with the respective video of every prompts and the relative prompts of the selected prompt. |
| Materials / content | Branching narrative with some circular paths. Cinematic style uses dimmed blue filters, dark vignettes, close-ups, and public spaces for a more cinematic feel. Lighting and color will be used to create atmosphere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | There will be a variety of content which follow a single plot, some decisions or pathways are circular, such as distinct stories, which can happen in any order as the protagonist is a teenager and will have to experience all of the stories anyways. The cinematic specifications include: the filter for indoor camera shots should always be dimmed blue with a dark blue vignette and a very clear focus on details or no focus if it is for a general indoor shot. In order to create more cinematic scenes, I will be planning ahead of time for the use of public spaces, such as parks or private properties. Camera angles can vary depending on the atmosphere and the effect I want to create. In addition, I will have to choose lighting and colour according to the current state of the film, such as if a character is in danger, I would use a slightly red tinted lighting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Safety              | For young viewers, focus on avoiding:<br>- **Mature themes:** Catfishing, doxing, kidnapping, etc.<br>- **Inappropriate language and actions:** Strong words or graphic violence.<br>- **Unnecessary violence:** Minimize blood and self-harm.<br>- **Risky stunts:** Ensure proper safety measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | In the content of the final product, I believe the only concerns are how appropriate the scenes and context of the film are towards the younger audiences, if it will expose them to explicit content or knowledge, such as catfishing, doxing, kidnappings, etc... Furthermore, safety consideration should be included in the script, firstly which is the correct use of language and method of delivery, such as explicit actions or words. Furthermore, during the filming process, there should be as less explicit content such as blood, self-harm as possible unless necessary. If stunts are needed, they should be performed with precautions and preparations beforehand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Size                | - **Accessibility:** Easy to access through modern browsers on most devices (Windows 8+).<br>- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** High-speed CDN to deliver smooth playback of high-definition videos (up to 2k resolution at 60 frames per second).<br>- **Video Length:** Scenes will be limited to 2-3 minutes each to optimize interactivity and reduce file size.<br>- **Video Size:** Each scene will be approximately 500MB to 1GB due to high video quality and visual effects.<br>- **Display Resolution:** Videos will scale to the user's device screen size (percentage-based), with a maximum display of 2k resolution.  | The final video which should be displayed on the website should be easy to access (through a browser and a modern browser which accepts recent versions of css, above win8) and the cdn should be of a speed which can deliver high definition videos up to 2k60fps. The volume of the video should be moderated and satisfactory, moreover, the scenes which are included can't surpass certain limits, which reduces the interactivity and quality of the interactive film in this case I will be aiming for 2 - 3 minutes per scene. The scene should weigh approximately 500mb-1gb per scene due to the higher video quality and visual effects. Overall the final resolution of the screen will be displayed to scale (by percentage), so the final video quality being displayed at one's device may vary, but it will only go as high as 2K video quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
