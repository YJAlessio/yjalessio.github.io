          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            There are countless crypto tokens in the crypto space, many of which are very risky and contain many disadvantages, such as: Volatility, Security vulnerabilities and the lack of transparency, Limited adoption and real-world use cases, in addition to the restricted scalability.</span></mark>

            Aeon is a reflection token built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that aims to provide holders with passive income while also being integrated into an external dAPP project to encourage user engagement and growth. The token is decentralized and can only be obtained through decentralized exchanges (DEXs),<mark data-author="AL" style="--hue: 276.9"
              ><span> ensuring a fair and transparent distribution.</span

              5% to holders: This is the reflection reward that holders receive.
